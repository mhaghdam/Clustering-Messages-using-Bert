# Clustering-Messages-using-Bert
# Message Clustering using BERT and HDBSCAN

This Python script clusters messages related to a specific dataset using BERT for tokenization and HDBSCAN for clustering.

## Description

The script processes messages from a CSV file, tokenizes them using BERT language model, reduces their dimensionality, and performs clustering using HDBSCAN. The primary goal is to group similar messages together based on their content.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input Data:**
   - Place the messages in a CSV file named `Messages.csv` (adjust file name if needed).

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script `message_clustering.py` to perform message clustering.

   ```bash
   python message_clustering.py
Output:
The script will generate the following output files:
sparse_matrix.npz: Saved sparse matrix after BERT processing.
Messages_Labels.csv: CSV file containing clustered messages and their labels.
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn transformers scipy numpy
Configuration
Adjust the parameters inside the Python script for tokenization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering if needed.
File Structure
message_clustering.py: The main Python script for message processing and clustering.
Messages.csv: Input CSV file containing messages.
sparse_matrix.npz: Saved sparse matrix after BERT processing.
Messages_Labels.csv: Output CSV file containing clustered messages and their labels.
Acknowledgments
This project uses the BERT model from Transformers by Hugging Face.
HDBSCAN library is used for clustering.
